            <h2>Help Irving Subs Feed COVID-19 First Responders.</h2>
            <body>
                As everyone knows, both hospitals and our local restaurants are going through tough times: hospital workers are putting their lives on the line to save others, and restaurants are hurting without business.<br><br>

                To help do our part, Irving Subs has organized this campaign to raise funds to donate meals to nearby hospitals.<br><br>

                100% of proceeds are directed to Irving Subs, which will in turn be used to make nourishing and delicious meals for healthcare workers. This will allow us to continue paying our staff and show appreciation for the real heroes in this crisis. If it is within your means to help out, please consider donating!<br><br>
